I drove through the United States and noticed some duplicate town and city names. I wonder...how many duplicates are there?
How many street names occur more than once despite not being shared on some contiguous road? How many cities have the same 
name despite having no relation? 

Why not scrape Wikipedia or some other data store...and assesmble a list of every town and city in every state...
and then get to work with figuring out how many dupes there are and which name is most common?! Sure sounds like
a fun little project. ;D
